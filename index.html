    		<h2>About Me</h2>
    		<p class="about-me">A <span class="font"> year ago</span> I realized that something was missing from my life. I loved my job (and still do), there was no doubt that, but I also began to feel like I needed more; a <span class="font">new goal</span> perhaps that could satisfy my curiosity, my creativity. That's when I've started to learn front-end development, and with that I've finally <span class="font">found my happy place.</span><br>Imagine the joy I've felt every time I sat down in front of my computer and thought about what to <span class="font">create </span>next! I had no trouble learning and developing my skills on my own, as I've been a self-motivated and independent person all my life. So far I've learnt how to use <span class="font">HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, </span> and how to work on responsive design. My personal favourite is mminimalistic design, due to its clean and elegant features. But I'm not planning to <span class="font">stop</span> here:<br> I'm always looking for the latest design elements, because I want my knowledge to be up to date, and my clients to have the coolest websites out there. <br><br><span class="font">Can't wait to work with you!</span></p>
